# Third-party notices

Geo routing is opt-in and off by default. The datasets below are not shipped in this repository. `npm run geo:fetch` downloads the pinned v2fly release assets into `data/geo/` after checking the official `.sha256sum` files. Those binaries stay git-ignored.

Loyalsoldier and sing-box geo builds are GPL-3 and are not used.
